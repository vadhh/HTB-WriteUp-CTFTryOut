## Objective  : Analyze gerber files 
## Assets     : 13 gerber files

## Method of Solve
I will use KiCad as a gerber files viewer software to analyze 
layer-by-Layer Visual Inspection :

Overlay Comparison: The most effective method is to overlay the original and modified Gerber layers directly. Many Gerber viewers allow this.
        - Look for any traces that are added, removed, redirected, or have different widths.
        - Look for pads that are missing, added, or have different shapes/sizes.
        - Check for changes in solder mask openings or silkscreen markings.

and i found the flag on the first layer
